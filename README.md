# Recordings Enabler

This tool works as a *worker* deployed on an *Heroku* machine.

It does the following things:

1. **Searches** through Korean and European **League of Legends** Challenger players with the help of the Riot API
2. **Enables** the **recording** of the league spectator packets on https://porofessor.gg/ for future use by the main tool: https://github.com/Maulorian/LeagueUploader.
